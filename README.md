## Introduction
The acquired MS data are often processed by available software tools for molecular identification and quantitation. Quality control is an essential step to ensure the accurate molecular measurement because contaminants or mechanical artifacts inevitably exist in the acquired MS data. Here we present a software tool, called DeNox, which can efficiently extract signals of interest from LC-MS data (given protein database search reports or quantified metabolites). DeNox can process multiple raw files simultaneously and is suitable for proteomic and metabolomic researches.

## How to Use

First LC-MS data need to convert to mzML format as input files.To extract signals of interest from LC-MS data, DeNox requires report file (In metabolomic, e.g., i-MetQ, XCMS) or an identification result (In proteomic, e.g., MSFragger) as input file.
